# Introduction

In this chapter we will use Newton's second law to solve different types of problems

$$\sum_i\vec{F_i}=m\vec a$$

We will then use numerical integration to solve harder problems.
You can already install the following python libraries:

- [x] `numpy`
- [x] `matplotlib`

and import them in your scripts.

=== "Python"
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ```
=== "Ocaml"
    ```ocaml
    let stdio = <void> in
    stdio;;
    ```
